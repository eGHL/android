eghl-sdk-v2.4.0r1.aar
1. The version v2.4.0r1 support API 17. However, we do not recommend merchant to use this version since Android only enabled TLS 1.2 by default after API 19.
2. Due to PCI Compliance, eGHL Payment Gateway is required to use protocol 1.2.
4. In the other word, the device with Android below 4.4 version might not be able to load eGHL payment page.

* For Query and Capture, eGHL SDK had enabled TLS 1.2 manually for API >= 16 and lower than 19
* For Sale & Auth, we did not enabled it for TLS 1.2 since it is using webview to load the payment page.
